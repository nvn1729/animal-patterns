Animal Patterns is a simple Alexa kid's skill developed using AWS Lambda and the Alexa Skills Kit for Python SDK.

Animal Patterns is an educational game for preschool and kindergarten-age kids who are developing an awareness for patterns. The game presents a series of patterns and asks kids to complete them.

Example patterns:

```
- bear, lion, bear, lion -> What comes next?
- dog, rooster, turkey, dog, rooster, turkey, dog, rooster -> What comes next?
```

Animal Patterns randomly selects from various pattern types and automatically adjusts the difficulty of patterns based on prior responses.
